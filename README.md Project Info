INTRO AND SUMMARY STATS 

  There are 2 datasets of FDA provided by Bigquery public data sets. First dataset is FDA_food.food_enforcement which ranges from 20 Jun 2012 TO 8 Dec 2021, with total of 
21,525 recall cases due to product's potential health problems for the public. In average, 2,152 recall cases were recorded per year, with data range of 1,088 to 3,203.
  The second dataset is FDA_food.food_events that collected over 16 years (between 01 Jan 2004 to 31 Mar 2020) and 91,776 reported cases reported by individuals. According 
 to the dataset, per year total of 5,398 reports were recorded with ranging between 1,788 to 10,798.


MAIN FINDNIGS FROM ANALYSIS NO.1 BY SQL:

Top 5 companies by numbers of recall cases are:
1) Garden-Fresh Foods Inc (632 cases),
2) Newly Weds Foods Inc (438 cases), 
3) Good Herbs Inc (353 cases), 
4) C & S Wholesale Grocers Inc (330 cases), 
5) Whole Foods Market (313 cases)
out of 21,525 total cases throughout USA over 10 years of range. 
However, few branchees of Whole Foods Market with slightly different names, such as Whole Foods Market Group Inc or Whole Foods Market North Atlantic Kitchen etc, 
does have some cases and aggregating all those cases, total recall number reaches 380 which potentially could move the company to TOP3 rank /further analysis is needed/.

While majority of recall cases status were identified as voluntarily removed the products from market by the firm, there are 396 cases (~.018%) were ordered by FDA to 
remove or correct the marketed products. Further, ~70% total mandated cases were associated with only 2 companies, namely Sunset Natural Products and Iowa Select 
Herbs LLC.
